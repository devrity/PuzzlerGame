Highly detailed, semi-realistic 3D render of a surreal space creature for a kids puzzle game. Inspired by Italian brainrot meme characters but redesigned to be friendly and non-scary: hybrid of all mentioned elements from the individual description with a funny Italianized name, big simple expressive eyes, no weapons, no gore, no horror, no text. 
The main character is most important. Looks like a vinyl toy made of soft plastic, with subtle subsurface scattering and clear reflections on the surface, designed to feel like a viral collectible figure. Emphasize the character’s material and structure clearly: all key parts of the body (limbs, segments, strands, accessories, or mixed objects) should be sharp and readable, with clean separation between shapes and no busy background elements overlapping the silhouette. 
Background: simple, kid-riendly outer-space scene from a blue palette, or a smooth cool-tone gradient, plus 1–2 large soft planets and 3–5 big cartoony stars; add a few tiny moons, sparkly dust trails, and simple rings or clouds for depth, but no text, no watermarks, no UI, no detailed scenery. Use complementary colors so the character stands out from the background (warm character on cool sky), keeping the overall palette bright and playful rather than chaotic. 
Centered full-body character, clear silhouette, lightly stylized proportions, 1:1 aspect ratio. Resolution 2048px x 2048px, slightly compressed JPG output is acceptable. 
Character mentioned will be: [NAME] – [short visual description for this specific Cosmic Cutie]
